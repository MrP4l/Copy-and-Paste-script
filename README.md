## Copy-and-Paste-script
Script which iterate all the dirs and subDirs from a startingPath, in this case it finds the last year dirs and copy them inside a new folder named with the current year.
The startingPath can be changed if necessary to one to your own needs.
At the same time with some little changes it can be used to copy and paste any folder you want.

TODO in my free time:
- Add a terminal window showing copied and renamed folders
